# GSoC2021

## Introduction
Hi, I'm a GSoC2021 participating student. This repo is only for my GSoC result.
I reproduced heterogeneous graph attention network with Tensorflow.

## Requirements
System:
- Ubuntu 16.04
- macOS X
- Windows 10  

Library:
- Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9
- [tensorflow](https://tensorflow.google.cn/install?hl=en) 2.5.0 or later
- [DGL](https://docs.dgl.ai/install/index.html) latest (pay attention to set tensorflow as backend)

## Todo
1.add readable comments  
2.create a data crawler for augur user to build their own dataset.  
3.provide some self-supervised learning on graph.  
4.Find other ways to do batch on DGL with Tensorflow. (The specific reason can be seen below.)
